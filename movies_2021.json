    "description": "Donny, a trucker for W.E.C. Coal, runs over and kills Kharis Redwater, an anti-mining activist, while Kharis walks alone at night on an indigenous people reservation. Tribal police officer Betty Stonechild consoles Kharis' mother Mary Lynne while investigating the case with mountie Andy Evanshuk. Diner owner Frances helps manage the body.\n\nWEC surveyor Beth brings her fiancé Ray Patel with her to help assess the land for a coal mining operation. Beth complains of a foul smell while a blackbird circles overhead. An invisible entity suddenly mauls Beth to death. Betty and Andy investigate, but question Ray's unbelievable account of what supposedly happened.\n\nDonny harasses game warden Stacey Cole, an Army veteran with PTSD, outside Frances' diner. Stacey pistol-whips Donny in his face, which results in her suspension.\n\nGary, a poacher working for WEC, parks on the reservation to drink beer with his girlfriend Jessica. Gary complains of a foul smell while a blackbird circles overhead. The invisible entity suddenly kills Gary. Betty and Andy are stunned at the similarities between Gary and Beth's unusual deaths.\n\nBecause Stacey is an expert tracker, Betty deputizes her to help with the search for whatever is stalking their reservation. Stacey enlists additional help from her uncle Carson Stonefeather, who is a respected tribal elder.\n\nThe invisible entity attacks Carson while he and Stacey hunt for it. Stacey rushes Carson to the hospital. Andy dismissively speculates that drug addiction or mass hysteria is responsible for what victims believe is happening. Betty defends her people as Stacey insists it was Kharis who attacked them. Carson cryptically asks, \"Where is her heart?\"\n\nBetty's online research reveals that Kharis was protesting against the tribal council for selling a mining license to WEC without proper approval. Additional research also connects Carson and Frances, the latter of whom appropriated native culture despite having a different heritage. Betty asks her 14-year-old nephew Ben, whom she raises, to see video interviews of Kharis and Carson he recorded for a class project. Carson's interview implies he betrayed the reservation by allying with WEC on the profitable mining operation.\n\nBetty discovers Kharis' body is missing. Betty confronts Frances, who only says that Betty should ask Mary Lynne what happened to her daughter's body. Betty then shows Stacey that her research revealed Kharis only attacked people affiliated with WEC, including Carson.\n\nAndy arrests Donny for carelessly shooting an old woman he thought was the unknown entity. Frances tells Andy that Donny tried to date rape her on the night Kharis died. Although drugged at the time, Frances remembers being in Donny's truck when he chased down and ran over Kharis.\n\nBen notices a blackbird circling overhead while practicing hockey with a friend. Ben later calls his aunt to tell her he is going to apply for an internship with WEC. Betty warns Ben to return home immediately. Kharis suddenly attacks the boy. Ben furiously pedals his bike back to the house.\n\nBetty and Stacey rush to the house to protect Ben. Both women get into a violent confrontation with Kharis.\n\nSwayed by a heart-to-heart conversation she had earlier with Stacey, Mary Lynne tearfully throws the heart from her daughter's corpse into a fire. At the same time, Kharis drops to the ground outside Betty's house. Stacey hacks off the vengeful ghost's head.\n\nAndy arrives at Betty's house. Stacey, Betty, and Ben all lie about what really happened.\n\nWhile watching the heart burn together, Mary Lynne tells Frances there is one more thing Kharis must do before finally resting. Handcuffed in the back of Andy's patrol car at Betty's house, Donny detects a strange odor. Kharis suddenly attacks him.",
